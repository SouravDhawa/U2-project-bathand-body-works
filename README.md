I want to thank Masai School for this great opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance my coding and life skills.
We have tried our level best to make use of the knowledge that we have gained so far at Masai School to come up with our first project.
Getting Started:-

It was a very challenging journey for me and for all my team members as we had to complete the project within the time of construct week, so we faced different challenges as it was our first project and we did not have any experience working in a team so we didn’t know how to manage everything within the time period. So we started with planning and studying the website, then we distributed the workflow, the roles, and responsibilities and with great collaboration, we managed the work, and completed this project.

Company Details:-

We had to make a clone of the “ Bath and body works” website. It was founded in 1990 in New Albany, Ohio and has since expanded across 6 continents. In 1997, it was the largest bath shop chain in the United .This company provides mainlly dallyuseable product. there is lot’s more product for costmer’s with very good quality.
